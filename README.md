# Bots, bots, more bots!



## Good bots 

* Code readability - writing it for noobs, prefer functions over scripts 
* Avoid comments unless you are trying to prove 
* Unit testing - have coverage for all funcitons, mock them if needed
* Postive confirmaiton - confirm whatever the bot was trying to do is actually done 
* Error handling - avoid show raw stacktrace 
* Logging / communication 
* Security - not logging out any sensitive information in any way 

## Bad bots 

* destory everything without tell the user
